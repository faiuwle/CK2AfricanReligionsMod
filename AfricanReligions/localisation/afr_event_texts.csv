EVTDESC_AFRREL003;The Inna, the mother of us all, for long has being reduced to the role of a mere subject or adviser of powerful rulers.\nBut those dark days are over today. All the great Magadjas have met today in the court of [From.GetTitledName] and have invoked the bori spirits to elevate [Root.RelHead.GetTitledName] to a divine character.\n\nThe Inna, possessed by the spirit of Magiro, the oldest and wisest of the bori, has received the authority to decide on all the spiritual issues that concern the faithful. The drums and marimbas rumble through the streets while the great mother is carried by her parishioners to the Kano temple, from where she will now rule the city until the end of time.;;;;;;;;;;;;x

EVTDESC_AFRREL004;To all my faithful,\nFor long the unbelievers have lived in our lands, shared our tables and enjoyed the protection of our spears.

For this reason I authorize the lords to tax their unfaithful peasantry.\nLovingly, your Inna;;;;;;;;;;;;;x

The new commander of the band has made an oath to only fight in the name of the true faith, and only pledge his spear to those marching in the name of Tanit. Generations after the fall of Numidia, its orphans will fight only for the Amazigh faithful.;;;;;;;;;;;;;x

EVTDESC_AFRREL016;In ancient times when Dido reigned in her city of gold and spices, when Hannibal and Hasdrubal commanded the armies of Numidia in European lands, when the Berber ruled the earth and the Phoenician the sea, there was a dream named Carthage. A dream that ended when the Italian eagle divided our people and plundered our lands, covering our hopes with salt.\n\nToday the Phoenicians are only a memory, but we children of Numidia are still here, and we still venerate the great goddess Tanit. And with great effort we have managed to restore her empire, to once again make ours all that the sea and the desert touch.;;;;;;;;;;;;;x

Only time will tell if this new empire will achieve supremacy in the Mediterranean Sea or if it will perish like its predecessor.;;;;;;;;;;;;;x
EVTDESC_AFRREL017_ROME;One would believe that killing one hundred thousand men and salting their land would be enough for them to learn their lesson, but still, here we are.

Today it is me who sits on the throne of Dido, and for that reason alone the sacred oath made in the name of the goddess Tanit cannot be ignored.\n\nMany will say that [From.GetDynName] is no true Roman and that the new realm is in no way the Roman Empire.

EVTOPTA_AFRREL058;The Lion is to be feared!;;;;;;;;;;;;;x
EVTOPTB_AFRREL058;The Tan Dowa are not for me.;;;;;;;;;;;;;x
EVTDESC_AFRREL060;There are hundreds of gods worshiped among the Amazigh, many taken from the cult of Egypt, the mythology of the Greeks or our own traditions as Berber peoples. Making a small offering could earn me the favor of one of these great gods.;;;;;;;;;;;;;x
EVTOPTA_AFRREL060;Time to chose.;;;;;;;;;;;;;x
EVTOPTB_AFRREL060;Maybe another time.;;;;;;;;;;;;;x
EVTDESC_AFRREL061;I raise a prayer to the heavens and the earth under my feet, I imagine the holy lands of the Maghreb in all its extension and I feel a great peace. But to what god am I raising my prayers?;;;;;;;;;;;;;x
EVTOPTA_AFRREL061;Tanit, the great mother.;;;;;;;;;;;;;x
EVTOPTB_AFRREL061;Änti, the mighty giant.;;;;;;;;;;;;;x
EVTOPTC_AFRREL061;Gurzil, the bull of war.;;;;;;;;;;;;;x
EVTOPTD_AFRREL061;I had something else in mind.;;;;;;;;;;;;;x
EVTOPTA_AFRREL062;Magec, lady of the sun.;;;;;;;;;;;;;x
EVTOPTB_AFRREL062;Set, lord of chaos.;;;;;;;;;;;;;x
EVTOPTC_AFRREL062;Maybe another deity has what I require.;;;;;;;;;;;;;x
EVTDESC_AFRREL063;Tanit is the mother goddess who brings the rains to the arid lands and gives fertility to women without children. Tanit was first worshiped among both Numidians and Phoenicians, eventually becoming the patroness of Carthage. From there, her cult spread to all the Mediterranean.;;;;;;;;;;;;;x
EVTOPTA_AFRREL063;Her blessing will bring happiness and love to my family.;;;;;;;;;;;;;x
EVTDESC_AFRREL064;Änti or Antaeus was a powerful giant, born of the very earth, who became the greatest fighter in the whole world because he was invincible as long as he was touching his mother. The Greek men tell that he was defeated by Heracles, but we Amazigh know the truth - he simply returned to his mother's womb, in the Tangier, waiting for a new challenger.;;;;;;;;;;;;;x
EVTOPTA_AFRREL064;With the blessing of Änti I will also be invincible.;;;;;;;;;;;;;x
EVTDESC_AFRREL065;Gurzil is the great god-bull of war. Many warriors sought his blessing on the battlefield. Ierna dedicated his life to the faith to gain strength against the Greek emperor, and Dihya bore his image when she confronted the Islamic invaders.;;;;;;;;;;;;;x
EVTOPTA_AFRREL065;I raise a prayer to the great bull, bring death to my enemies.;;;;;;;;;;;;;x
EVTDESC_AFRREL066;The sun lady Magec is beautiful like no other and full of blessings even to those who do not revere her. In the old traditions the lady of the sun was kidnapped by the nefarious Guayota, who held her inside a volcano in the Guanche Islands, where men speak in whistles.;;;;;;;;;;;;;x
EVTOPTA_AFRREL066;The sun that illuminates all land will let me understand it better.;;;;;;;;;;;;;x
EVTDESC_AFRREL067;Set is a god of chaos, the desert, the wild storms and of violence among men. In the ancient times when the pharaohs still ruled their river kingdom, they also though he was the god of foreigners, because he loved us Amazighs. Set is a trickster but also a protector who fights a constant battle against death itself.;;;;;;;;;;;;;x
EVTOPTA_AFRREL067;Give me some of your cleverness, lord of chaos.;;;;;;;;;;;;;x
EVTDESC74000_AWUSSU;I had invited a monkey trainer to the carnival and the performance went well until one of the monkeys refused to ride on top of a pig. The trainer beat the monkey with a stick which led the other monkeys to attack the trainer, biting him and hitting him with his own stick.;;;;;;;;;;;;;x
EVTDESC74005_AWUSSU;The carnival’s Archery contest went very well. The clout and the space around it was filled with arrows, some of them had hit the bullseye, some of them had missed the clout altogether. The winner was a modest man who disappeared rather quickly after he collected his prize.;;;;;;;;;;;;;x
EVTDESC74010_AWUSSU;A traditional narrator of hikayat or folktales has being telling a funny story about a foolish king. After a while you start to realize that the fool in the tale is a metaphor for you. Everybody is now laughing at the buffoonery of the storyteller.;;;;;;;;;;;;;x
EVTOPTA74010_AWUSSU;That's actually a very clever metaphor;;;;;;;;;;;;;x
EVTOPTG74010_AWUSSU;If I pay him more, perhaps he will talk about something else;;;;;;;;;;;;;x
EVTDESC74015_AWUSSU;A group of horse riders has come to the carnival to perform the Tbourida, a traditional synchronized spectacle of horsemanship and archery. Some of the small children in the crowd seem to be scared of so many horses galloping in unison.;;;;;;;;;;;;;x
EVTOPTE74015_AWUSSU;I can't wait! I love the Tbourida!;;;;;;;;;;;;;x
EVTDESC74020_AWUSSU;When my advisor asked me to sponsor this year’s carnival I could never have guessed I would regret it. The gathered crowd took the opportunity to proclaim a dahir, sentencing one of my vassals to being tied to a camel and kicked out of town!;;;;;;;;;;;;;x
EVTDESC74025_AWUSSU;The ahwash is a traditional for of theatrics involving song, dance, poetry, and drumming. A large group of performers has being organized among the people of the city for the carnival and I have come to pay them a visit before their presentation.;;;;;;;;;;;;;x
EVTOPTA74025_AWUSSU;I'd prefer if you performed 'The Old Marabout';;;;;;;;;;;;;x
EVTOPTB74025_AWUSSU;The ahwash is our most precious tradition;;;;;;;;;;;;;x
EVTDESC74030_AWUSSU;With the carnival coming, a large supply of hashish has entered the city from the east. The marabouts insist that eating the substance is damaging for the soul, but the common folk seem to enjoy the effect it produces.;;;;;;;;;;;;;x
EVTOPTA74030_AWUSSU;How bad can it be? Let the plebs have their fun;;;;;;;;;;;;;x
EVTOPTB74030_AWUSSU;The marabouts could use some hashish to calm down;;;;;;;;;;;;;x
EVTOPTD74030_AWUSSU;If the gods don’t approve it neither do I;;;;;;;;;;;;;x
EVTDESC74035_AWUSSU;I don’t know what I was thinking hiring the Marrakshi Camel Riders to parade through the streets. Camels are not horses, they can’t do pirouettes, not that that stopped the riders from trying. After falling to the grown and crashing into a group of scared women I must admit that the parade is ruined.;;;;;;;;;;;;;x
EVTDESC74040_AWUSSU;A shuwafa is a fortuneteller, and there are plenty in the city, more than usual due to the carnival. Their omens usually come from cowrie-shells and similar silly things but there are still people who believe in their rituals and interpretations.;;;;;;;;;;;;;x
EVTOPTB74040_AWUSSU;Banish them from the carnival;;;;;;;;;;;;;x
EVTDESC74042_AWUSSU;A marabout is disturbing the carnival by rambling nonsense about sacrificing babies to the goddess Tanit. His drivel is frightening some, but most of the crowd around him is mocking and laughing at him.;;;;;;;;;;;;;x
EVTOPTB74042_AWUSSU;Kick him out, he does not belong at the carnival;;;;;;;;;;;;;x
EVTDESC74045_AWUSSU;The local clan chiefs of [Root.Location.GetName] complain about the peasants getting too noisy with their music and dancing during the carnival.;;;;;;;;;;;;;x
EVTOPTA74045_AWUSSU;Tell them to learn how to appreciate the music;;;;;;;;;;;;;x
EVTOPTB74045_AWUSSU;Restrict the musical performances in the city;;;;;;;;;;;;;x
EVTDESC4105_AWUSSU;A poet has being performing an epic in the traditional asefru composition in front of a large crowd, the piece is about the prominent people of [Root.Location.GetName]. You do notice that he keeps riming your name with various synonyms of the word ‘genitals’;;;;;;;;;;;;;x
EVTOPTA4105_AWUSSU;That doesn’t even rhyme!;;;;;;;;;;;;;x
EVTDESC4170_AWUSSU;Its ragged fur and sorrowful eyes made the lion look pitiful, but when its trainer started playing his laud the lion started dancing. The dancing lion and his trainer have become a very popular carnival attraction.;;;;;;;;;;;;;x
EVTOPTD4170_AWUSSU;Training a lion can't be too hard;;;;;;;;;;;;;x
EVTDESC72109_BIDA;Our fertile lands give us life, but this is not without a price. For this reason each year a young woman is chosen to be a bride for the old snake spirit of the waters that is known as Bida. All the people of the domain must be invited for a feast to celebrate the occasion in which the blessed lady will be chosen.;;;;;;;;;;;;;x
EVTOPTA72109_BIDA;Only life can pay for life.;;;;;;;;;;;;;x
EVTDESC72001_BIDA;The wandering griot entered the castle telling the story of the kings of old and did not stop until he found me. With a flourishing bow and one long, sad tone from his balafon he finished his poem and asked for my patronage.;;;;;;;;;;;;;x
EVTDESC72003_BIDA;The best part about preparing a feast is deciding what foodstuff to serve. I must purchase mutton, millet and rice, spices, yogurt and tea, honey for the desserts, cheeses and perhaps even sweet potato or baobab leaves.;;;;;;;;;;;;;x
EVTDESC72008_BIDA;If I want to impress my guests it is essential that I have the pelt of a lion on display. Who will get the prestigious task of facing against the king of beasts in the great hunt?;;;;;;;;;;;;;x
EVTOPTC72008_BIDA;I will hunt the lion myself;;;;;;;;;;;;;x
EVTDESC72010_BIDA;Most of the preparations for the feast before the sacrificial ceremony have been made, now I only have to send out the invitations!;;;;;;;;;;;;;x
EVTDESC72011_BIDA;Dear [Root.GetBestName], I hereby invite you to oversee the annual sacrifice to Bida in [From.Location.GetName]. Your presence at the ceremony and feast would be greatly appreciated and I look forward to your attendance.\n\n[From.GetTitledFirstName];;;;;;;;;;;;;x
EVTDESC72012_BIDA;Dear [Root.GetTitledFirstName], I thank you for your invitation but I will not be able to attend the ceremony. In fact, I refuse to set my foot in the same castle as you!\n\nRespectfully,\n\n[From.GetTitledFirstName];;;;;;;;;;;;;x
EVTDESC72020_BIDA;Much thought and consideration had been put into the courses served at [Root.Liege.GetTitledFirstName]'s feast. The mutton was so tender it almost melted on the tongue, the chicken delicious, the palm wine was properly aged, but the dessert outdid all the other dishes: the most delicious thiacry I have ever tasted...;;;;;;;;;;;;;x
EVTDESC72021_BIDA;The courses at the feast were few but palatable. We were served mutton, some sort of fish, a few palm wines, millet and a small dessert. It was not really the abundance of food I had expected [Root.Liege.GetTitledFirstName] to serve at [Root.Liege.GetHerHis] feast.;;;;;;;;;;;;;x
EVTOPTB72021_BIDA;Where's the rice?;;;;;;;;;;;;;x
EVTDESC72022_BIDA;Instead of the millet, the palm wine and all kinds of meats I had thought [Root.Liege.GetTitledFirstName] would serve at [Root.Liege.GetHerHis] feast, we were served courses that could have been served at dinner at a much poorer [Root.Liege.GetManWoman]'s table.;;;;;;;;;;;;;x
EVTDESC72065_BIDA;The griot sang and the ladies wept, the griot sang and the lords laughed. His performance at my feast was above my expectations and I congratulated myself for hiring him.;;;;;;;;;;;;;x
EVTDESC72066_BIDA;I am not ashamed to admit I both laughed and cried when the griot sang. The griot's performance at [From.GetTitledFirstName]'s feast was extraordinary!;;;;;;;;;;;;;x
EVTDESC72110_BIDA;The annual sacrifice has come to an end and the guests are now departing, satisfied with your hospitality. Watching the riverbank, you wonder if it’s all worth it.;;;;;;;;;;;;;x
EVTOPTA72110_BIDA;We do as we must.;;;;;;;;;;;;;x
EVTDESC72111_BIDA;[From.GetTitledFirstName]'s ceremony presenting this year’s sacrifice to Bida is finally over. The young maiden has been sent to the serpent’s embrace. Now is time to go home and return to our lives.;;;;;;;;;;;;;x
EVTOPTA72111_BIDA;The loss of a good woman, a necessary evil.;;;;;;;;;;;;;x
EVTDESC72112_BIDA;I have to cancel the Bida ceremony due to the war I am currently fighting against one of my enemies. Perhaps after the war I might throw a victory feast.;;;;;;;;;;;;;x
EVTDESC72113_BIDA;Dear [Root.GetTitledFirstName], due to the unfortunate war I have to cancel this years sacrifice. I hope you will be able to attend the victory fest I plan to have after the war.\n\n[From.GetTitledFirstName];;;;;;;;;;;;;x
EVTDESC_AFRREL040;The snake’s bride must be selected with precision - for this reason one hundred young ladies appear before you on the back of one hundred horses. The guests of the feast must select the most beautiful among all but as host you have the final say.;;;;;;;;;;;;;x
EVTOPTA_AFRREL040;Whatever plebian girl they like is fine.;;;;;;;;;;;;;x
EVTOPTB_AFRREL040;One of my own court would show generosity.;;;;;;;;;;;;;x
EVTOPTC_AFRREL040;My own daughter will have the honor.;;;;;;;;;;;;;x
EVTOPTD_AFRREL040;I do need to empty a cell.;;;;;;;;;;;;;x
EVTOPTE_AFRREL040;Can I be the sacrifice? I am pretty.;;;;;;;;;;;;;x
EVTDESC_AFRREL041;Once everyone has gone to bed in preparation for the ceremony, somebody knocks at your door. It’s the snake’s fiancée, and she is crying. She says between sobs: “My [Root.GetTitle], please, I don’t want to die. I will give you anything, my loyalty, my life, my heart.” You feel a sting in your heart seeing that beautiful face covered in tears.;;;;;;;;;;;;;x
EVTOPTA_AFRREL041;This atrocity is over, you will not suffer under my watch.;;;;;;;;;;;;;x
EVTOPTB_AFRREL041;The snake demands, and we must pay.;;;;;;;;;;;;;x
EVTOPTC_AFRREL041;Perhaps some other girl could replace you.;;;;;;;;;;;;;x
EVTDESC_AFRREL042;A procession marches to the river in the morning and with them rides [bida_sacrifice.GetTitledName] carrying a golden spoon. Once there, the head priest attaches heavy weights to the girl’s legs and places her in a small boat. Everybody is then commanded to look away. You hear a splash as the girl is swallowed by the river. The viper of the waters has got his bride.;;;;;;;;;;;;;x
EVTDESC_AFRREL042_PEASANT;A procession marches to the river in the morning and with them rides the peasant girl carrying a golden spoon. Once there, the head priest attaches heavy weights to the girl’s legs and places her in a small boat. Everybody is then commanded to look away. You hear a splash as the girl is swallowed by the river. The viper of the waters has got his bride.;;;;;;;;;;;;;x
EVTDESC_AFRREL042_SUICIDE;A procession marches to the river in the morning and you ride with them carrying a golden spoon. Once there the head priest attaches heavy weights to your legs and places you in a small boat. Everybody is then commanded to look away as the priest pushes you to the river. This is your wedding, but you don’t see the groom.;;;;;;;;;;;;;x
EVTOPTA_AFRREL042;Only life can pay for life.;;;;;;;;;;;;;x
EVTOPTA_AFRREL042_SUICIDE;What? Where is the snake?;;;;;;;;;;;;;x
EVTDESC_AFRREL043;[From.GetTitledNameWithNick] has selected you as this year’s sacrifice to Bida. You are forced to parade to the river. Once there the head priest attaches heavy weights to your legs and places you in a small boat. Everybody is then commanded to look away as the priest pushes you to the river. The snake will have you as their offering.;;;;;;;;;;;;;x
EVTOPTA_AFRREL043;So this is the embrace of the serpent.;;;;;;;;;;;;;x
EVTDESC_AFRREL044_GOOD;Every year a young bride is sacrificed to the river, and every year you wonder if it’s all worth it.\n\nYour suspicions are gone for the time being. The snake must love his new bride, because the land is more fertile than ever and the mines keep the revenue coming.;;;;;;;;;;;;;x
EVTDESC_AFRREL044_BAD;Every year a young bride is sacrificed to the river, and every year you wonder if it’s all worth it.\n\nMaybe it’s all a charade, the mines are not producing and the rains are late this year.;;;;;;;;;;;;;x
EVTOPTA_AFRREL044_GOOD;We pay with life, and we get life.;;;;;;;;;;;;;x
EVTOPTA_AFRREL044_BAD;Cursed snake.;;;;;;;;;;;;;x
EVTDESC_AFRREL045;This year’s intended sacrifice [bida_sacrifice.GetTitledName], has died prematurely. Without a proper sacrifice the ritual for Bida is now ruined and the event must be canceled immediately.;;;;;;;;;;;;;x
EVTOPTA_AFRREL045;The snake will be displeased.;;;;;;;;;;;;;x
EVTDESC_AFRREL047;With [bida_sacrifice.GetTitledName] no longer in your dungeon, this year’s ceremony has being left without a proper sacrifice. The ritual must be postponed.;;;;;;;;;;;;;x
EVTOPTA_AFRREL047;The snake will be displeased.;;;;;;;;;;;;;x
EVTDESC_AFRREL070;Our people, more than men and women, are stallions and mares. We are born on the backs of steeds and therefore we celebrate on horseback. The Hawan Sallah is a beautiful opportunity to show this. A great parade will be organized for the pleasure of nobles and commoners, so that people can see how prosperous my reign is.;;;;;;;;;;;;;x
EVTOPTA_AFRREL070;What a great parade will this be!;;;;;;;;;;;;;x
EVTDESC_AFRREL071;The first thing to decide will be which horse will ride at the head of the parade. Of course it is an option to simply take one of the horses in your stables, but those old steeds will not impress anyone. Maybe it would be better to acquire a new horse for the occasion.;;;;;;;;;;;;;x
EVTOPTA_AFRREL071;Whatever is in my stables will suffice.;;;;;;;;;;;;;x
EVTOPTB_AFRREL071;I should buy a young mare.;;;;;;;;;;;;;x
EVTOPTC_AFRREL071;A mighty stallion, nothing less.;;;;;;;;;;;;;x
EVTOPTD_AFRREL071;The lion will ride a wild beast tamed by itself!;;;;;;;;;;;;;x
EVTDESC_AFRREL072;The Hawan Sallah is a great opportunity to show your riches and impress the curious. You could certainly call for the royal tailors to make you a dress of silk and gold, although perhaps it would be best to show humility among your subjects.;;;;;;;;;;;;;x
EVTOPTA_AFRREL072;What's wrong with what I am wearing?;;;;;;;;;;;;;x
EVTOPTB_AFRREL072;White robes are a sign of piety.;;;;;;;;;;;;;x
EVTOPTC_AFRREL072;I will ride covered in gold.;;;;;;;;;;;;;x
EVTOPTD_AFRREL072;I will dress in the dark mantle of those who bring the plague.;;;;;;;;;;;;;x
EVTTITLE_AFRREL073;The Great Parade;;;;;;;;;;;;;x
EVTDESC_AFRREL073;All the people of [Root.Capital.GetName] congregate on both sides of the main street of the city. An army of drummers advances among them, singing songs in honor of the bori, followed by dancers who perform impressive pirouettes.\n\nAt the end of all, the main show arrives, one hundred men on beautiful steeds and at the head of them [Root.GetTitledName]. The faithful subjects cheer the name of the [Root.GetTitle] and [Root.GetSheHe] responds by greeting them with grace. The [Root.GetTitle]’s [Root.HawanSallahClothes] [Root.HawanSallahClothesEffect]. Certainly this has been a glorious day.;;;;;;;;;;;;;x

hawan_sallah_unimpressive_clothes;however been the subject of some mockery;;;;;;;;;;;;;x
EVTOPTA_AFRREL073;Behold the glory of [Root.GetBestName]!;;;;;;;;;;;;;x
EVTDESC_AFRREL074;You've heard that your liege [From.GetTitledNameWithNick] has organized a grand parade as part of this year's Hawan Sallah. It would certainly be worth it to join that celebration in a way that brings excitement to the occasion. Suddenly you have an idea that will make you the life and soul of the party: you are going to show up at the parade on the back of a mighty elephant.;;;;;;;;;;;;;x
EVTOPTA_AFRREL074;Everybody is going to love it!;;;;;;;;;;;;;x
EVTOPTB_AFRREL074;This may be the worst idea I ever had.;;;;;;;;;;;;;x
EVTDESC_AFRREL075;The parade runs without any inconvenience, or at least that's what it seems, until you hear a rumble that echoes through the streets of [Root.Capital.GetName]. Screams of terror and laughs of mockery are heard in the crowd and you can not understand what is happening.\n\nIt is then that you see the problem, it is [From.GetTitledNameWithNick] that has come to be part of the parade, not on the back of a stallion but mounted on an elephant bigger than a house. The beast makes its way through the streets while you can not help but gawk at it.;;;;;;;;;;;;;x
EVTOPTA_AFRREL075;That idiot is ruining my parade!;;;;;;;;;;;;;x
EVTOPTB_AFRREL075;I like this one, that’s some spunk.;;;;;;;;;;;;;x
EVTDESC_AFRREL076;On the day of the celebration you arrive at the parade on the back of a beautiful elephant, to the surprise of all. As you ride the animal you can hear the screams of the crowd, they are certainly full of excitement. For some reason [From.GetTitledFirstName] seems not to appreciate the beautiful gesture.;;;;;;;;;;;;;x
EVTOPTA_AFRREL076;If [From.GetSheHe] does not appreciate Stampy then I do not appreciate [From.GetHerHim].;;;;;;;;;;;;;x
EVTDESC_AFRREL077;On the day of the celebration you arrive at the parade on the back of a beautiful elephant, to the surprise of all. As you ride the animal you can hear the screams of the crowd, they are certainly full of excitement. [From.GetTitledFirstName] seems absolutely delighted as [From.GetSheHe] approaches to pet the elephant.  This was certainly the greatest idea you've ever had.;;;;;;;;;;;;;x
EVTOPTA_AFRREL077;Any friend of Stampy is a friend of mine.;;;;;;;;;;;;;x
EVTDESC_AFRREL078;You are watching the parade organized by your liege [From.GetTitledNameWithNick] for the Hawan Sallah. Everything seems in order until you see a drunkard throwing himself at the riders shouting "Ostriches are prettier than any horse!"\n\nYou have come to enjoy the parade and you will not let the imbecile ruin it, so you put him in his place with one fist. [From.GetTitledFirstName] seems impressed.;;;;;;;;;;;;;x
EVTOPTA_AFRREL078;I seem to have made a new friend!;;;;;;;;;;;;;x
EVTDESC_AFRREL079;Although most of your subjects seem happy to see the parade you have organized, one of them does not seem to agree. The man, clearly drunk, stands in your way screaming that the parade would be better if we rode zebras and ostriches.\n\nJust when you think the afternoon is ruined, someone appears in the crowd and knocks out the drunk with a single blow, allowing you to continue. It's [From.GetTitledNameWithNick], who has come to your rescue.;;;;;;;;;;;;;x
EVTOPTA_AFRREL079;Ha! A thousand thanks, [From.GetTitledFirstName]!;;;;;;;;;;;;;x
EVTDESC_AFRREL080_MAN;While you are riding at the head of the parade, a young man approaches you with a single red rose. He looks like a simple farmer, but he has a charming appeal, like the rose he carries with him. He also has beefy arms and an iron abdomen, it's worth mentioning.\n\nYou get off your horse and accept the rose with kindness.;;;;;;;;;;;;;x
EVTDESC_AFRREL080_WOMAN;While you are riding at the head of the parade, a young lass approaches you with a bouquet of wild flowers. She looks like a humble girl, but she has a unique beauty, like the flowers she carries with her. She also has generous hips and full breasts, it's worth mentioning.\n\nYou get off your horse and accept the flower bouquet with kindness.;;;;;;;;;;;;;x
EVTOPTA_AFRREL080;You honor me and my faith.;;;;;;;;;;;;;x
EVTOPTB_AFRREL080_MAN;Do you want to ride with me? I can sit on your lap.;;;;;;;;;;;;;x
EVTOPTB_AFRREL080_WOMAN;Do you want to ride with me? You can sit on my lap.;;;;;;;;;;;;;x
EVTDESC_AFRREL081;The parade stretches longer than you expected, the sun shines with great force and your horse begins to look irritated. It flutters from one side to the other and annoys the other riders. Suddenly the rider at your side loses control of his horse and collides with yours. Your mount goes completely crazy, it starts jumping on its hind legs and it does not take long for you to lose your balance and fall from its back.;;;;;;;;;;;;;x
EVTOPTA_AFRREL081;Here comes the ground!;;;;;;;;;;;;;x
EVTOPTB_AFRREL081;I can fall on my feet!;;;;;;;;;;;;;x
EVTDESC_AFRREL082_IMPRESSIVE;When I selected my mount I was somewhat worried that my horse might not be enough. My concerns turned out to be baseless. The [Root.HawanSallahHorse] has impressed all the commoners.;;;;;;;;;;;;;x
EVTDESC_AFRREL082_UNIMPRESSIVE;When I selected my mount I was somewhat worried that my horse might not be enough. My concerns turned out to be correct. The [Root.HawanSallahHorse] has not been enough to impress anybody.;;;;;;;;;;;;;x

EVTOPTB_AFRREL082;What do they know about horsemanship?;;;;;;;;;;;;;x
EVTDESC_AFRREL083;The parade finally comes to an end, but the festivities are not over. Now is the time of the great race in which the bravest riders of [Root.Capital] will compete to decide which of them is the most skilled.\n\nOf course it would be frowned upon for someone from your high position to participate in the race, but there is no reason not to make the game more interesting. Maybe it would be a good idea to place a bet with one of the wealthy merchants of the city.;;;;;;;;;;;;;x
EVTOPTA_AFRREL083;I will make a small bet.;;;;;;;;;;;;;x
EVTOPTB_AFRREL083;I will take a risk.;;;;;;;;;;;;;x
EVTOPTC_AFRREL083;All-in, cowardice is for poor people!;;;;;;;;;;;;;x
EVTOPTD_AFRREL083;Gambling is for the wicked.;;;;;;;;;;;;;x
EVTDESC_AFRREL084;Next you must choose a horse to bet on. You could make a safe bet on the white Arabian, but the profits would be small. The palomino barb is an interesting choice, a medium risk for a medium gain. And there is the bay Andalusian, an unlikely winner, but it would make you a fortune.;;;;;;;;;;;;;x
EVTOPTA_AFRREL084;Let’s play it safe with the Arabian.;;;;;;;;;;;;;x
EVTOPTB_AFRREL084;I will take a risk with the barb.;;;;;;;;;;;;;x
EVTOPTC_AFRREL084;The Andalusian! Why are people laughing?;;;;;;;;;;;;;x
EVTDESC_AFRREL085;At the start of the race an old soldier on the back of a black stallion quickly takes the lead. In the first three laps there seems to be no doubt who will be the champion this year. But a challenger finally manages to reduce the distance with the black steed on the last lap, it is a young ragged girl on the back of the [Root.HawanSallahBetHorse], which makes you happy because you bet on her.\n\nThe two riders fight for the front, neck to neck as the spectators shout at the edge of their seats. Finally it is the young woman on the [Root.HawanSallahBetHorse] who manages to win by a head.;;;;;;;;;;;;;x

EVTDESC_AFRREL088;While the sun sets, the festivities come to an end. People return to their homes and the horses are returned to their stables. This year the Hawan Sallah was a splendid occasion and it was all thanks to you.;;;;;;;;;;;;;x

EVTOPTA_AFRREL090;Such a shame!;;;;;;;;;;;;;x
EVTDESC_AFRREL092;The riders stop momentarily when an idiot starts running naked in front of the horses. Your companions ask you to punish the fool, but the crowd seems fond of the exhibitionist's clownery.;;;;;;;;;;;;;x
EVTOPTA_AFRREL092;To the dungeon with the pervert!;;;;;;;;;;;;;x
EVTOPTB_AFRREL092;Live and let live.;;;;;;;;;;;;;x
EVTDESC_AFRREL093;Several young children have gathered to watch the riders, their eyes light up seeing the brave warriors. Maybe you can cheer them up even more.;;;;;;;;;;;;;x

EVTOPTB_AFRREL093;Get out of here, brats!;;;;;;;;;;;;;x

EVTOPTA_AFRREL094;The glory of our armies...;;;;;;;;;;;;;x
EVTOPTB_AFRREL094;Virtuous is the spirit that...;;;;;;;;;;;;;x
EVTOPTC_AFRREL094;Earth will not share the rafter's envy...;;;;;;;;;;;;;x
EVTDESC_AFRREL095_GOOD;The minutes pass and the riders finish with their pirouettes, but the crowd doesn't care about horses anymore, they are delighted with your words. You certainly are great with words.;;;;;;;;;;;;;x
EVTDESC_AFRREL095_BAD;The riders suddenly stop their pirouettes and indicate that it is time to continue. They are really doing you a favor. Every word you say is clumsier than the last and the crowd looks at you as if you were some kind of fool.;;;;;;;;;;;;;x
EVTOPTA_AFRREL095;...and that’s the only truth!;;;;;;;;;;;;;x
EVTOPTB_AFRREL095;...In conclusion, more yams?;;;;;;;;;;;;;x
EVTDESC_AFRREL096;The Hawan Sallah includes several musical performers, one of which marches right beside you playing their instruments. You wonder if they take requests.;;;;;;;;;;;;;x

EVTOPTC_AFRREL096;Please play ‘Army Arrangement’.;;;;;;;;;;;;;x
EVTDESC_AFRREL097;A warehouse collapsed and the grain stored there poured out right into the main street of [Root.Capital.GetName], blocking the route. Your companions indicate you that you should get off of the horse until the warehouse owner can collect his grain.;;;;;;;;;;;;;x

EVTDESC_AFRREL_106;Alkali is a bori from the Yan Riga court, a patron of the dyers and weavers. In a visit to the local market I consider that the best way to honor him is to get myself a new wardrobe of elegant tunics.;;;;;;;;;;;;;x
EVTOPTA_AFRREL_106;Only the finest fabric.;;;;;;;;;;;;;x
EVTOPTB_AFRREL_106;This is too ostentatious for me.;;;;;;;;;;;;;x
EVTDESC_AFRREL_107;Doguwa is a bori from the Babbaku court, a patron of wrestlers. She is a very complex being made of two halves that not always agree with each other. I am tempted to summon her presence but it could carry a great risk, for I don’t know which half will answer my call.;;;;;;;;;;;;;x
EVTOPTA_AFRREL_107;Dear mother, please come to me!;;;;;;;;;;;;;x
EVTOPTB_AFRREL_107;No, it’s too risky;;;;;;;;;;;;;x
EVTDESC_AFRREL_108;You feel the spirit take possession of your body and you start to sing her song “With her white cloth she has come”. This is the lovely mother of wrestlers, and she has come to give you her strength.;;;;;;;;;;;;;x
EVTOPTA_AFRREL_108;I feel it already!;;;;;;;;;;;;;x
EVTDESC_AFRREL_109;You feel the spirit take possession of your body and you start to sing her song “With her white cloth she has come”. However this is not the blessed half of Doguwa, but the wild one of the bush, and has decided to punish you for calling her name.;;;;;;;;;;;;;x
EVTOPTA_AFRREL_109;No, please. My eyes!;;;;;;;;;;;;;x
EVTDESC_AFRREL_110;Kulita is a bori from the Tan Garki court, a little drummer that marches with the armies. Inspired by him I have experimented with using young boys beating drums to mark the footsteps of my marching troops. This may be a real tactical advantage.;;;;;;;;;;;;;x
EVTOPTA_AFRREL_110;One, two, one, two;;;;;;;;;;;;;x
EVTDESC_AFRREL_111;As my illness worsens I have tried contacting with the bori spirits. Today my prayers have being answered as I felt how I was possessed by KaiKai, one of the Yayan Zanzanna children of the plague. The lady of the disease took it away, my pain is finally gone.;;;;;;;;;;;;;x
EVTOPTA_AFRREL_111;I must sacrifice two hens in her name.;;;;;;;;;;;;;x
EVTDESC_AFRREL_112;Ayu the manatee is one of the Tan Dowa wild bori, he drags his victims underwater and drowns them. Kadda the crocodile is a lot more direct, as he breaks them with his jaws. In a recent spirit possession I had the opportunity to choose which of these spirits to call.;;;;;;;;;;;;;x
EVTOPTA_AFRREL_112;The sneaky manatee.;;;;;;;;;;;;;x
EVTOPTB_AFRREL_112;The ferocious crocodile.;;;;;;;;;;;;;x
EVTDESC_AFRREL_113;Recently I have being practicing a lot of wrestling, as the giant Änti did. It not only has made me feel great but it seems like my new defined abdomen has caught the eye of my [From.GetHusbandWife].;;;;;;;;;;;;;x
EVTOPTA_AFRREL_113;Do you like what you see?;;;;;;;;;;;;;x
EVTOPTB_AFRREL_113;Go away, I have to keep my head on the next match.;;;;;;;;;;;;;x
EVTDESC_AFRREL_114;Gurzil is a god of war, but one must not forget that he is also a bull. The herders always look for his protection when watching over the cattle. I could make a sacrifice to the horned figure if I want my own lands to have healthy heifers.;;;;;;;;;;;;;x
EVTOPTA_AFRREL_114;The bull shall provide.;;;;;;;;;;;;;x
EVTOPTB_AFRREL_114;I have no money for sacrifices.;;;;;;;;;;;;;x
EVTDESC_AFRREL_115;The sun shines over all, and it can be both a blessing and a curse. Magec is the radiant sun, and as one of her faithful I always await for her blessing. Lately the sun has certainly favored the crops, the harvest has being plentiful and the profits have being flowing.;;;;;;;;;;;;;x
EVTOPTA_AFRREL_115;Praise the sun!;;;;;;;;;;;;;x
EVTDESC_AFRREL_116;Strange noises at night, objects moving on their own and terrifying messages written on the ceiling have convinced the entire court that the palace is haunted. I don’t have the heart to admit that it’s just my latest prank, just a game to celebrate Set the lord of chaos.;;;;;;;;;;;;;x
EVTOPTA_AFRREL_116;Maybe I should stop, I am scaring people.;;;;;;;;;;;;;x
EVTOPTB_AFRREL_116;This is so fun. Next, blood on the walls.;;;;;;;;;;;;;x
