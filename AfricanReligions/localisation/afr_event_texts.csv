EVTTITLE_AFRREL003;The Inna's Apotheosis;;;;;;;;;;;;;x
EVTDESC_AFRREL003;The Inna, the mother of us all, for long has being reduced to the role of a mere subject or adviser of powerful rulers.\nBut those dark days are over today. All the great Magadjas have met today in the court of [From.GetTitledName] and have invoked the bori spirits to elevate [Root.RelHead.GetTitledName] to a divine character.\n\nThe Inna, possessed by the spirit of Magiro, the oldest and wisest of the bori, has received the authority to decide on all the spiritual issues that concern the faithful. The drums and marimbas rumble through the streets while the great mother is carried by her parishioners to the Kano temple, from where she will now rule the city until the end of time.;;;;;;;;;;;;x
EVTOPTA_AFRREL003;Glory to our mother, [Root.RelHead.GetBestName]!;;;;;;;;;;;;;x
EVTDESC_AFRREL004;To all my faithful,\nFor long the unbelievers have lived in our lands, shared our tables and enjoyed the protection of our spears. This is an example of the infinite tolerance of our faith. However it’s time for these fools who reject the truth of the Jan Gari to repay our generosity. For this reason I authorize the lords to tax their unfaithful peasantry.\nLovingly, your Inna;;;;;;;;;;;;;x
EVTOPTA_AFRREL004;The Inna's word bring joy to my soul… and my pocket.;;;;;;;;;;;;;x
EVTDESC_AFRREL007;The Tan Garki are the children of the shield, the warrior spirits summoned by all of the great fighters of the central Sahel.\nRecently a group of devout soldiers has organized a meeting in the old city of Kano, at the great ceremony presided over by the Inna herself, the soldiers were possessed by the boris of war and took an oath to defend the faith by any means necessary.\n\nThe group of warrior devotees calls themselves the "Living Tan Garki" and are willing to fight for any ruler who marches his armies in the name of the Inna.;;;;;;;;;;;;;x
EVTOPTA_AFRREL007;The spirits themselves will now fight on our side!;;;;;;;;;;;;;x

EVTDESC_AFRREL009;The tyeddo are a caste of West African warriors, sometimes considered to be slave warriors. Recently the many communities of the A Tat Roog faith have pooled their resources together to assemble a new tyeddo army that would not be loyal to any particular king, but to the faith itself.\n\nThese Sacred Tyeddo soldiers will dedicate their lives to protect any devout of Roog and will guide their swords not by the command of monarchs, but by the Yoonir star.;;;;;;;;;;;;;x
EVTOPTA_AFRREL009;These faithful are slaves to Roog and no one else.;;;;;;;;;;;;;x
EVTOPTB_AFRREL009;Noble slaves, but still slaves.;;;;;;;;;;;;;x

EVTDESC_AFRREL011;In 703 the great Queen Dihya, last of the faithful Amazigh monarchs, was stripped of her rightful title by the invading Arab usurpers. For generations the remnants of their army and its descendants have wandered the Sahara selling their sweat and blood as mercenaries, dishonoring their heritage like vulgar sellswords.\n\nHowever, today everything changed. The new commander of the band has made an oath to only fight in the name of the true faith, and only pledge his spear to those marching in the name of Tanit. Generations after the fall of Numidia, its orphans will fight only for the Amazigh faithful.;;;;;;;;;;;;;x

EVTDESC_AFRREL014;In response to the endless aggression of the Abrahamic invaders, the Great [Root.GetTitledName] has made a call to all true believers of the Sudan to take arms in defense of the old gods.

EVTDESC_AFRREL016;In ancient times when Dido reigned in her city of gold and spices, when Hannibal and Hasdrubal commanded the armies of Numidia in European lands, when the Berber ruled the earth and the Phoenician the sea, there was a dream named Carthage. A dream that ended when the Italian eagle divided our people and plundered our lands, covering our hopes with salt.\n\nToday the Phoenicians are only a memory, but we children of Numidia are still here, and we still venerate the great goddess Tanit. And with great effort we have managed to restore her empire, to once again make ours all that the sea and the desert touch.;;;;;;;;;;;;;x

EVTDESC_AFRREL017;Something that seemed impossible has happened.  In the lands of North Africa the Amazigh leader [From.GetTitledNameWithNick] has made an important proclamation: the ancient Carthaginian Empire has been reborn from its ashes.\n\nThrough the streets of the old city of Carthage the marabouts dance singing chants in honor of the old Punic-Berber goddess Tanit, and all the pagans of North Africa make toasts in honor of the new emperor. Only time will tell if this new empire will achieve supremacy in the Mediterranean Sea or if it will perish like its predecessor.;;;;;;;;;;;;;x
EVTDESC_AFRREL017_ROME;One would believe that killing one hundred thousand men and salting their land would be enough for them to learn their lesson, but still, here we are. The pagan and grotesque [From.GetDynName], a worshiper of the demonic Punic goddess, has proclaimed the creation of a new Carthaginian Empire. This affront is certainly not something I can ignore as the head of the true Roman Empire.\n\nRome has defeated Carthage three times on the battlefield, and we are not afraid to do it a fourth time.;;;;;;;;;;;;;x

EVTDESC_AFRREL018_LATIN;To the [GetFromRootInsult] [Root.GetDynName], what was it that Cato the Elder used to say? Carthago delenda est?

EVTDESC_AFRREL018_ROME;To the [GetFromRootInsult] [Root.GetDynName], when my messengers gave me the news, I almost died of laughter. It seems you have committed the foolishness of resurrecting an empire that should have been confined to the history books.\nIt does not matter, as Emperor of the Romans and successor of Aeneas I will take care of plowing your armies as Aeneas plowed your predecessor.\nFrom Rome with love,\n[From.GetTitledName];;;;;;;;;;;;;x

EVTDESCLoR21_CARTHAGE;A wicked soul known as [From.GetDynName] has been proclaimed [From.GetTitledNameWithNick]. And just like that a new pretender to the corpse of our old enemy, Rome, has been brought into the world. We all know the tale of the noble queen Dido whose heart was broken by the lecherous Aeneas, making the queen proclaim eternal hate between the men of Rome and Carthage. Today it is me who sits on the throne of Dido, and for that reason alone the sacred oath made in the name of the goddess Tanit cannot be ignored.\n\nMany will say that [From.GetDynName] is no true Roman and that the new realm is in no way the Roman Empire. But I know in my heart of hearts that I will think of [From.GetHerHim] as Roman when I put my sword through [From.GetHerHis] heart.;;;;;;;;;;;;;x

Merchants set sails for places yet unexplored as once Hanno did.   Gold and prosperity once again fill the metropolises of Africa.

EVTOPTA_AFRREL051;I consider Yan Riga, the city spirits.;;;;;;;;;;;;;x

EVTOPTD_AFRREL052;Maybe another court has what I require.;;;;;;;;;;;;;x
EVTDESC_AFRREL053;The Yan Riga, that is, those who wear clothes, are the most civilized spirits. It is said that they live in cities and know about the wisdom of men who can read.

EVTOPTB_AFRREL055;Tan Garki are not for me.;;;;;;;;;;;;;x
EVTDESC_AFRREL056;Samari, the spirits of youth but also of femininity. Interestingly they are led by Ba-Gudu, the one who does not run, who is neither female nor young.

EVTOPTB_AFRREL057;Yayan Zanzanna are not for me.;;;;;;;;;;;;;x
EVTDESC_AFRREL058;The Tan Dowa are spirits of the jungle, they do not resemble any human but are nature in its purest state.

EVTDESC_AFRREL064;Änti was a powerful giant, born of the very earth, who became the most formidable fighter in the whole world because while he was in contact with his mother he became invincible.

EVTOPTB_AFRREL066;Magec is not for me.;;;;;;;;;;;;;x
EVTDESC_AFRREL067;Set is a god of chaos, the desert, the wild storms and of violence among men. In the ancient times when the pharaohs still ruled their river kingdom, they also though he was the god of foreigners, because he loved us Amazighs. Set is a trickster but also a protector who fights a constant battle against death itself.;;;;;;;;;;;;;x
