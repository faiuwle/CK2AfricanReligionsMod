EVTTITLE_AFRREL003;The Inna's Apotheosis;;;;;;;;;;;;;x
EVTDESC_AFRREL003;The Inna, the mother of us all, for long has being reduced to the role of a mere subject or adviser of powerful rulers.\nBut those dark days are over today. All the great Magadjas have met today in the court of [From.GetTitledName] and have invoked the bori spirits to elevate [Root.RelHead.GetTitledName] to a divine character.\n\nThe Inna, possessed by the spirit of Magiro, the oldest and wisest of the bori, has received the authority to decide on all the spiritual issues that concern the faithful. The drums and marimbas rumble through the streets while the great mother is carried by her parishioners to the Kano temple, from where she will now rule the city until the end of time.;;;;;;;;;;;;x
EVTOPTA_AFRREL003;Glory to our mother, [Root.RelHead.GetBestName]!;;;;;;;;;;;;;x
EVTDESC_AFRREL004;To all my faithful,\nThe fervor of the best who leave this world must be rewarded, as they have moved into the Jan gari and are now with the spirits. Their immortal souls will be revered as if they were boris. And those who refuse to come to the light must be swayed. I know that greed can sometimes be more moving than the sword, and so I authorize the lords to tax their unfaithful peasantry.\nLovingly, your Inna;;;;;;;;;;;;;x
EVTOPTA_AFRREL004;The Inna's word bring joy to my soul… and my pocket.;;;;;;;;;;;;;x
EVTDESC_AFRREL007;The Tan Garki are the children of the shield, the warrior spirits summoned by all of the great fighters of the central Sahel.\nRecently a group of devout soldiers has organized a meeting in the old city of Kano, at the great ceremony presided over by the Inna herself, the soldiers were possessed by the boris of war and took an oath to defend the faith by any means necessary.\n\nThe group of warrior devotees calls themselves the "Living Tan Garki" and are willing to fight for any ruler who marches his armies in the name of the Inna.;;;;;;;;;;;;;x
EVTOPTA_AFRREL007;The spirits themselves will now fight on our side!;;;;;;;;;;;;;x
EVTOPTB_AFRREL007;Possessed warriors? A most curious thing.;;;;;;;;;;;;;x
EVTOPTC_AFRREL007;These infidels are possessed by demons!;;;;;;;;;;;;;x
EVTDESC_AFRREL009;The tyeddo are caste of West African warriors, sometimes considered to be slave warriors. Recently the many communities of the A tag Roog faith have pooled their resources together to assemble a new tyeddo army that would not be loyal to any particular king, but to the faith itself.\n\nThese Sacred Tyeddo soldiers will dedicate their lives to protect any devout of Roog and will guide their swords not by the command of monarchs, but by the Yoonir star.;;;;;;;;;;;;;x
EVTOPTA_AFRREL009;These faithful are slaves to Roog and no one else.;;;;;;;;;;;;;x
EVTOPTB_AFRREL009;Noble slaves, but still slaves.;;;;;;;;;;;;;x
EVTOPTC_AFRREL009;A slave army? Pitiful.;;;;;;;;;;;;;x
EVTDESC_AFRREL011;In 703 the great Queen Dihya, last of the faithful Amazigh monarchs, was stripped of her rightful title by the invading Arab usurpers. For generations the remnants of their army and its descendants have wandered the Sahara selling their sweat and blood as mercenaries, dishonoring their heritage like vulgar sellswords.\n\nHowever, today everything changed. The new commander of the band has made an oath to only fight in the name of the true faith, and only pledge his spear to those marching in the name of Tanit. Generations after the fall of Numidia, its orphans will fight only for the Amazigh faithful.;;;;;;;;;;;;;x
EVTOPTA_AFRREL011;With their aid, North Africa shall be free once more.;;;;;;;;;;;;;x
EVTOPTB_AFRREL011;An old and proud group, if ever there was one.;;;;;;;;;;;;;x
EVTOPTC_AFRREL011;Just the remains of a defeated pagan army.;;;;;;;;;;;;;x
EVTDESC_AFRREL012;It seems that my interest in the the legends of the Sudan has come to the attention of one of their practitioners within the realm. We met and have had the most fruitful discussions about theology and other matters.;;;;;;;;;;;;;x
