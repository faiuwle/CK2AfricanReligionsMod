EVTTITLE_AFRREL003;The Inna's Apotheosis;;;;;;;;;;;;;x
EVTDESC_AFRREL003;The Inna, the mother of us all, for long has being reduced to the role of a mere subject or adviser of powerful rulers.\nBut those dark days are over today. All the great Magadjas have met today in the court of [From.GetTitledName] and have invoked the bori spirits to elevate [Root.RelHead.GetTitledName] to a divine character.\n\nThe Inna, possessed by the spirit of Magiro, the oldest and wisest of the bori, has received the authority to decide on all the spiritual issues that concern the faithful. The drums and marimbas rumble through the streets while the great mother is carried by her parishioners to the Kano temple, from where she will now rule the city until the end of time.;;;;;;;;;;;;x
EVTOPTA_AFRREL003;Glory to our mother, [Root.RelHead.GetBestName]!;;;;;;;;;;;;;x
EVTDESC_AFRREL004;To all my faithful,\nFor long the unbelievers have lived in our lands, shared our tables and enjoyed the protection of our spears. This is an example of the infinite tolerance of our faith. However it’s time for these fools who reject the truth of the Jan Gari to repay our generosity. For this reason I authorize the lords to tax their unfaithful peasantry.\nLovingly, your Inna;;;;;;;;;;;;;x

EVTDESC_AFRREL007;The Tan Garki are the children of the shield, the warrior spirits summoned by all of the great fighters of the central Sahel.\nRecently a group of devout soldiers has organized a meeting in the old city of Kano, at the great ceremony presided over by the Inna herself, the soldiers were possessed by the boris of war and took an oath to defend the faith by any means necessary.\n\nThe group of warrior devotees calls themselves the "Living Tan Garki" and are willing to fight for any ruler who marches his armies in the name of the Inna.;;;;;;;;;;;;;x
EVTOPTA_AFRREL007;The spirits themselves will now fight on our side!;;;;;;;;;;;;;x

Recently the many communities of the A Tat Roog faith have pooled their resources together to assemble a new tyeddo army that would not be loyal to any particular king, but to the faith itself.\n\nThese Sacred Tyeddo soldiers will dedicate their lives to protect any devout of Roog and will guide their swords not by the command of monarchs, but by the Yoonir star.;;;;;;;;;;;;;x
EVTOPTA_AFRREL009;These faithful are slaves to Roog and no one else.;;;;;;;;;;;;;x

The new commander of the band has made an oath to only fight in the name of the true faith, and only pledge his spear to those marching in the name of Tanit. Generations after the fall of Numidia, its orphans will fight only for the Amazigh faithful.;;;;;;;;;;;;;x

EVTDESC_AFRREL016;In ancient times when Dido reigned in her city of gold and spices, when Hannibal and Hasdrubal commanded the armies of Numidia in European lands, when the Berber ruled the earth and the Phoenician the sea, there was a dream named Carthage. A dream that ended when the Italian eagle divided our people and plundered our lands, covering our hopes with salt.\n\nToday the Phoenicians are only a memory, but we children of Numidia are still here, and we still venerate the great goddess Tanit. And with great effort we have managed to restore her empire, to once again make ours all that the sea and the desert touch.;;;;;;;;;;;;;x

EVTDESC_AFRREL017;Something that seemed impossible has happened.  In the lands of North Africa the Amazigh leader [From.GetTitledNameWithNick] has made an important proclamation: the ancient Carthaginian Empire has been reborn from its ashes.\n\nThrough the streets of the old city of Carthage the marabouts dance singing chants in honor of the old Punic-Berber goddess Tanit, and all the pagans of North Africa make toasts in honor of the new emperor. Only time will tell if this new empire will achieve supremacy in the Mediterranean Sea or if it will perish like its predecessor.;;;;;;;;;;;;;x
EVTDESC_AFRREL017_ROME;One would believe that killing one hundred thousand men and salting their land would be enough for them to learn their lesson, but still, here we are. The pagan and grotesque [From.GetDynName], a worshiper of the demonic Punic goddess, has proclaimed the creation of a new Carthaginian Empire. This affront is certainly not something I can ignore as the head of the true Roman Empire.\n\nRome has defeated Carthage three times on the battlefield, and we are not afraid to do it a fourth time.;;;;;;;;;;;;;x

EVTDESC_AFRREL018_ROME;To the [GetFromRootInsult] [Root.GetDynName], when my messengers gave me the news, I almost died of laughter.

We all know the tale of the noble queen Dido whose heart was broken by the lecherous Aeneas, making the queen proclaim eternal hate between the men of Rome and Carthage. Today it is me who sits on the throne of Dido, and for that reason alone the sacred oath made in the name of the goddess Tanit cannot be ignored.\n\nMany will say that [From.GetDynName] is no true Roman and that the new realm is in no way the Roman Empire.

Merchants set sails for places yet unexplored as once Hanno did.   Gold and prosperity once again fill the metropolises of Africa.

EVTDESC_AFRREL100;Many are the religious traditions of the Western Sahel, with different names for the primordial twins, the star Sirius and even for God himself.

EVTOPTC_AFRREL100;I choose the Malinke tradition.;;;;;;;;;;;;;x
EVTDESC_AFRREL101;The Serer practice “The way of the Divine”, the most complex faith in all of West Africa. They refer to the supreme god as Roog, the primordial twins as Yaab and Yop, and the great star Sirius as Yoonir.

EVTOPTA_AFRREL101;This truly is the way of the Divine.;;;;;;;;;;;;;x
EVTOPTB_AFRREL101;I will choose another path.;;;;;;;;;;;;;x
EVTDESC_AFRREL102;The way of the Dogon is often a mystery to the outsiders. They refer to the supreme god as Amma, the primordial twins as the Nommo, and the great star Sirius as Sigui.

EVTOPTD_AFRREL052;Maybe another court has what I require.;;;;;;;;;;;;;x
EVTDESC_AFRREL053;The Yan Riga, that is, those who wear clothes, are the most civilized spirits. It is said that they live in cities and know about the wisdom of men who can read.

EVTDESC_AFRREL054;The Babbaku, that is, the black ones, are inhabitants of rural villages.

EVTOPTB_AFRREL055;The Tan Garki are not for me.;;;;;;;;;;;;;x
EVTDESC_AFRREL056;Samari, the spirits of youth but also of femininity. Interestingly they are led by Ba-Gudu, the one who does not run, who is neither female nor young.

EVTOPTB_AFRREL056;The Samari are not for me.;;;;;;;;;;;;;x
EVTDESC_AFRREL057;The Yayan Zanzanna, the children of the plague, are child spirits with dominion over any disease, spreading smallpox and other evils among mortals.

EVTOPTB_AFRREL057;The Yayan Zanzanna are not for me.;;;;;;;;;;;;;x
EVTDESC_AFRREL058;The Tan Dowa are spirits of the jungle, they do not resemble any human but are nature in its purest state.

EVTDESC_AFRREL063;Tanit is the mother goddess who brings the rains to the arid lands and gives fertility to women without children.

EVTOPTA_AFRREL063;Her blessing will bring happiness and love to my family.;;;;;;;;;;;;;x
EVTDESC_AFRREL064;Änti or Antaeus was a powerful giant, born of the very earth, who became the greatest fighter in the whole world because he was invincible as long as he was touching his mother. The Greek men tell that he was defeated by Heracles, but we Amazigh know the truth - he simply returned to his mother's womb, in the Tangier, waiting for a new challenger.;;;;;;;;;;;;;x
EVTOPTA_AFRREL064;With the blessing of Änti I will also be invincible.;;;;;;;;;;;;;x
EVTDESC_AFRREL065;Gurzil is the great god-bull of war. Many warriors sought his blessing on the battlefield. Ierna dedicated his life to the faith to gain strength against the Greek emperor, and Dihya bore his image when she confronted the Islamic invaders.;;;;;;;;;;;;;x
